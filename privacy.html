                    <p><i>Information we collect automatically</i></p>
                    <p>We may collect standard internet log information about how and when you use the Klanto
                      Platform and the Services. This information may include but not be limited to, your IP address
                      and   location   data,   weblogs,   time,   date,   browser   used,   referring   web   addresses,   other

                      <p>When you use the Klanto app, as with many apps, certain limited data is required for the app to
                        function on your device. This data includes the type of device hardware and operating system,
                        unique device identifier, IP address, language settings, and the date and time the app accesses our
                        servers. We will use commercially reasonable efforts, given the limitations imposed upon us by
                        third party providers such as Apple Inc. and Google Inc., to clearly disclose what, if any
                        information is collected by the Klanto app, how it is used, and with whom it is shared.  Please
                        note, certain practices are outside of our control, for example, tracking by Google, Inc., Apple,
                        Inc., or your third-party telecommunications carrier.  We are not responsible for the actions of
                        such third parties.   You should always read and understand the policies of any third-party
                        provider, such as Google with respect to Android apps and Apple with respect to IOS apps, and
                        your wireless carrier, before making any purchase or downloading any app.</p>
                        <p>
                          In addition, to ensure that the Klanto Platform is optimized for ease of use, we or our service
